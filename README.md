## Linting

You can check for PEP8 violations by running `flake8`:

flake8 --max-line-length=120
```

## Documentation

To build these docs:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```


## Usage

Execute main.py. 

"main.py" is currently missing a lot of the more interesting and fun features, but should give you a taste. 
If you want to play around with the innards a bit more paste the contents of "region" into your python console.
